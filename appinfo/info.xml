	<description><![CDATA[Enable users to configure notifications with customized conditions in their Flow configuration.

Users are empowered to configure a "Send a notification" Flow in their personal settings. They can choose between the events being triggered, and other conditions like filetypes, assigned tags, time ranges and more. They can specify an inscription so that when the notification appears they will have context.

To use the `Flow Notifications` app, ensure that the `Notifications` app is installed and enabled. The `Notifications` app provides the necessary APIs for the `Flow Notifications` app to work correctly.

When an event happens where all conditions are apply, the user will receive a regular Nextcloud notification.
